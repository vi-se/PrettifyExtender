# PrettifyExtender
A user script to add extensions to Google Prettify on Stack Exchange sites.

---

Right now, it adds [hail2u's Vim extension][1] from and sets it as the default
for:

- [Vi and Vim](http://vi.stackexchange.com)
- [Meta Vi and Vim](http://vi.stackexchange.com)
- Posts with tags matching `vim` on other SE sites

Code blocks manually identified as another language using `<!-- language:
foo -->` will be left untouched.

I hope to add a UI and the ability to add other extensions.
